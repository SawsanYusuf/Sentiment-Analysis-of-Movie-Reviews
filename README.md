The goal is to predict the sentiment for a given review 
from a user with the help of either classification or deep learning algorithms.

## Dataset:

**Data fields:** 
* id — Unique ID of each review

* label — Sentiment of the review; 1 for positive reviews and 0 for negative reviews

## Inspect and explore data
We encountered no issues with data types and found no null values. We did, however, identify and remove some duplicate entries. The relative frequencies of the classes in the dataset are close, indicating that the data is balanced.
